Give a thumbs up, now the collections with more thumbs up would naturally get the attention of more users to use the collection",

            <p class="mb-4">During the research phase, there was little information I could get from a lot of users, but
                the major concern was the ability to delegate tokens to multiple validators at the same time to improve
                investment strategy and yield.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The second phase of the research was walking through all the existing staking platforms on
                both Solana and its competitor Fantom and I realized that there were a lot of unknown terminologies and
                parameters involved to stake with a validator, as some folks don't even know how to check for a
                validator</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Finally, some users feel comfortable delegating their tokens with a validator to invest,
                while some others prefer the conventional staking of Solana with a token pair in a pool as it's more
                controlled by the protocol and less prone to malicious Validators.</p>

                    of user-defined criteria.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">Give users the ability to learn about how to delegate and Choose validators on the
                    platform.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">Provide users the ability to see which validators theyâ€™ve delegated to, how much
                    theyâ€™ve delegated, and how much theyâ€™ve accrued in rewards.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">Give users who want to stake the regular way in a Pool and Farm that opportunity to
                    also invest in the protocols offerings</li>
