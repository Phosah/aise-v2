                <p class="mb-4">The next step was to have scheduled calls with people from the sales team as they are the ones that have been on the field and gotten direct hints on the feedback of some of the customers who use the Bento Payroll product for their organization and had issues managing their organization as well.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The next few days were a series of calls with the support team and support team lead and this was to get insights on issues that have been reported as bento runs open support and feedback channel that takes user's requests and issues to process so the support team has had direct info on the user's pain points</p>
                <p>The final days were calls with the engineering team to also get insights from them and the size of the team so I could properly align business goals, user needs, and Engineering strengths in the design process.</p>

I designed the product in a way that its easy to set up a mail and assign an onboarding/work buddy to guide the employee during his/her initial stages. Also the ability to assign necessary software, and hardware for productivity. Finally, all necessary o0nboarding documents including work manual and welcome videos can also be shared</p>
