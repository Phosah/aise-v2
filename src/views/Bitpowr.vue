        "While joining the team, there was an existing project that quoting the CEOs and stakeholders felt was selling the values of the company well, had a poor UX, and was not standard enough for them to be recognized as a world-class company, so I was tasked with taking the project to the next level and making it one that is to be recognized in the space",

    paragraphs: [
        "The first course of action was to go through the existing design that had a poor UX and didn't sell the values of the company well, I took the design file and began my study.",
        "But just like most designers the temptation to try your hands on changing the design immediately especially when the visuals feel they can be improved was the order of the day but I had to prioritize the users hence I ran some testings on the current product with 2 stakeholders and 4 current users of the product to hear first hand how they felt using the product and carrying out tasks, their limitations and pain poi8nts, from there I was able to identify the points in the user flow",
        "I had them also use the products live and speak out as frequently as possible so I can experience them better using the product and this gave insights on things that  are needed to improve the UX"

    paragraphs: [
        "After carrying out a series of interviews the next step was carrying out research on competitors a few of them which include Fireblocks, Bitgo, Bittrex, etc",
        "This was a bit difficult as these competitors had limited materials out there to know how their businesses work and very few demos done on youtube to watch and study so I had to resort to scheduling a demo session with them. Cheesy move yep ðŸ™ˆ, but I needed to know how they work not to steal but to have an idea of how users are being served and what could be done better",
        "After scheduling some demos with the companies i analysed the products with the best flows and those with good solutions and this was used as an initial benchmark to surpass and improve upon for the next phase of bitpowr"
