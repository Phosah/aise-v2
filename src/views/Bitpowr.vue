                <h2 class="mb-6 text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold font-new-paris-kingsize">Learnings and More</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">I enjoyed working on bitpowr as it was my first exposure to web3 asides from the conventional Centralized exchanges. I got to learn the dynamics of the blockchain and how it can be used in real-life activities, and learned how to be transparent in task flows s this is a project that deals in financial transactions so the slightest mistake can cost a lot, and unlike traditional banks that cash can be reversed from a wrong address it's not so easy for such on the blockchain so every action carried out has to be clear and precise</p>
                <p>Working on a web3 product that is both an Enterprise product and a B2C product gets you to think about a wide range of users and ensure the solutions meets their needs and this helped in improving my skills as User Experience designer and design thinker</p>
