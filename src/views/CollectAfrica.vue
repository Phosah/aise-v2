                    <p>I conducted some research alongside the product manager to discover what we are building, despite having a brief given we conducted some research to validate, and have a deeper understanding of the pain points of the users and bridge it with the business goals. The UX phase began with getting to know the users and their behaviors and the research goal was aimed at getting a clear idea of the problem as it directly affects the users, and uncovering their needs and frustrations to better understand how to create a better experience for them. This enabled me to get a better understanding of the pain points of our users and empathize more. Research started with interviews to get some qualitative data and from the data gotten, we decided to work towards an MVP, and from the gotten pain points we needed some quantitative data to identify the most sorted solutions of our target market to properly roll out an MVP</p>

                        >It's hard enough to get a single person or business to trust you to help handle their finances when dealing with businesses and financial activities I have discovered that transparency and ease of use are of top priority in getting the best of results and user retention. And also the understanding of business goals to ensure the business makes a profit has to be placed as another priority hence a lot of calls with stakeholders and the aligning of design and business goals has to be established from the start.</p>
                        <p>I enjoyed this project and I got to realize how we can help people who run businesses if they focus on the business itself they have more time and strategic juice to focus and take their organization to greater heights</p>
