                    <p class="mb-4">For every crypto investor, there has been one major statement we get advised with
                        before we being
                        and
                        that is “Don't put in more than you can lose”. But this is one piece of advice we know but like
                        me,
                        a lot of users fail to uphold.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The frequent dips in cryptocurrencies have been that of major benefits and also
                        losses on a lot
                        of
                        users which often places users in a tight spot especially those who have a dire need for their
                        investments.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">A lot of users tend to embrace the HODL stance and keep their funds for two major
                        reasons; The
                        faith
                        in the tokens to rise back based on its historical proofs and the pain of selling now and
                        incurring
                        all the loss.</p>

                    <p>This has kept a lot of users facing serious financial problems, those who have to starve or lack
                        some basic amenities because their funds are tied up suffer from it.</p>

                    <h3 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-bold">What Does Xerxes aim to Achieve?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Crypto Investments do not need to be one that financially cripples you, the goal is
                        financial liberation
                        both short and long term.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Xerxes hopes to bring a solution that allows users access to lending systems whereby
                        you can borrow
                        tokens either stable coins or others with the collateralization of your crypto investments and
                        sort out
                        whatever financial needs, you don't need to tell us without ever having to sell and be on the
                        losing
                        side of the dip</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Also what is a DeFi Protocol without investment opportunities, so we aim to make the
                        system embrace the
                        decentralized nature of web3, hence we aim to facilitate a peer-peer lending system where the
                        borrowers
                        would be incentivized with profit for borrowing their extra cash to those who need it in a
                        secured
                        nature.</p>

            <h1 class="mb-6 text-6xl font-bold">Research Time</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">During the research phase, we engaged with a lot of users in the web2 space and also the
                web3 space
                because the goal of the project is to understand the psychology of users wanting to borrow funds and
                leverage off lending protocols, and due to this technology being utilized in the web2 space already we
                needed to understand from a solutions perspective. But we understand that the methods of the approach of
                lending in web3 are different because of the peer-peer fashion we also needed to understand how similar
                protocols in the web3 space carry out lending and borrowing.</p>

            <p>After listening carefully to a couple of users in some one on one interviews scheduled on google meet,
                and some sharing the vision session with the product owners I was able to identify some business needs
                and at the same time identify the pain points of the users and able to come up with some deductions.</p>
